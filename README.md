# mips-simulator
MIPS simulator in C#

Features:
- Parser combinator using FParsec
- Basic instruction set including **integer** arithmetic, branch, jump
- Stack support

TODO:
- static memory support

Notes:
- I included a factorial MIPS example so demonstrate the recursion support thanks to stack
